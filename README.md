Water Quality Analysis
This project analyzes the potability of water samples based on physicochemical features using a dataset titled water_potability.csv.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

ph: pH value of water

Hardness: Hardness of water

Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm

Chloramines: Amount of chloramines in ppm

Sulfate: Sulfate concentration in mg/L

Conductivity: Conductivity of water in μS/cm

Organic_carbon: Organic carbon content in ppm

Trihalomethanes: Trihalomethanes concentration in μg/L

Turbidity: Measure of water cloudiness

Potability: Target variable (1 if safe to drink, 0 otherwise)

🔍 Project Overview
The notebook includes:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Basic inspection and preprocessing of missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations to understand feature distributions and relationships with potability.

Feature Correlation: Heatmaps and pairplots to identify important variables.

Modeling (optional): Can be extended to include classification models to predict water potability.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

Seaborn

Matplotlib

📊 Future Work
Implement ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Improve model performance through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning

Deploy as a web app (e.g., Streamlit)

📁 How to Run
